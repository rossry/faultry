# Faultry

Faultry is a clean, responsive theme for Ghost 0.5+ blogs. You can view a demo (with a few minor modifications) [at Ross's blog](http://blog.rossry.net). It is based heavily on [Sheet](https://github.com/brianokeefe/sheet), by Brian O'Keefe

Sheet uses [Pure](https://github.com/yui/pure/) for its responsive grid. It uses [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) from Google Fonts, and includes [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io), [jQuery](http://jquery.com), and [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/).

## Installation

See the [Ghost documentation on installing themes](http://docs.ghost.org/themes/).

## Copyright & License

Copyright (c) 2015 Ross Rheingans-Yoo

I do intend to someday release Faultry under some open license, but honestly, I feel that it's not yet ready for production, so it is currently not licensed for public use, even to parties acquiring this source code. Until I release a future version of Faultry with such a license, I'd appreciate it if you didn't use it (though you're certainly free to download it and read it yourself).

Sheet _is_ released MIT license, so if you like most of what's here, feel free to pull-request from [there](https://github.com/brianokeefe/sheet).
